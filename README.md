Greetings All, 
My application is named Teachin.
Teachin is an social networking application, that allows teachers to create user profiles on our website. When a user creates their profile they have the options of customizing their profile by adding a subject, submitting a diploma, and adding their school. Users can delete their profiles. Users have a personal record of their messages, followers, people who they are following and likes. User can also upload an image fo themselves. Users can also communicate with each other by create posts and commenting. 

The technology I used for this application was Flask Python Framework, Javascript, Bootstrap, html and css, restful apis, PostgreSQL.
